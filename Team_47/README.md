Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, making early detection critical for improving patient survival. This project introduces an interpretable deep learning system for categorizing lung cancer into multiple classes using CT scan imagery. The system employs transfer learning with ResNet-50 as its foundation, enhanced through extensive data augmentation and Grad-CAM visualization for model transparency. Using the publicly available IQ-OTHNCCD dataset containing three distinct categories—benign conditions, malignant tumors, and healthy lung scans—the methodology achieves 92.8% validation accuracy, with precision at 91.5%, recall of 90.9%, and F1-score of 91.2%. The integration of explainable AI methods provides clinical transparency, positioning this approach as suitable for computer-assisted diagnosis in pulmonary radiology and demonstrating superior performance compared to standard models.
