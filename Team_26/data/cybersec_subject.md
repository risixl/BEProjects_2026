Cybersecurity studies techniques to protect systems and data from threats and vulnerabilities.

Detailed topics:
- Cryptography basics: symmetric vs asymmetric encryption, hashing, public key infrastructure (PKI), TLS/SSL.
- Secure coding practices: input validation, output encoding, secure session management.
- Common vulnerabilities: OWASP Top 10 (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, broken authentication), mitigation strategies.
- Network security: firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), secure network design.
- Incident response and forensics: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, post-mortem.
- Threat modeling and risk assessment: attack surface analysis, threat mitigation strategies.

Practical exercises: vulnerability scanning, basic pentesting methodologies, secure architecture patterns.
