Data Structures are fundamental to efficient algorithms and application performance.

Topics covered:
- Linear structures: arrays, linked lists (singly, doubly), stacks, queues, deques; implementations, time/space complexity.
- Trees: binary trees, binary search trees (BST), balanced BSTs (AVL, Red-Black), B-trees and B+ trees for disk-based storage, trie structures.
- Heaps and priority queues: binary heap, Fibonacci heap, operations and use-cases.
- Graphs: representations (adjacency list/matrix), traversals (BFS, DFS), shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning trees (Prim, Kruskal), topological sort.
- Hash tables: hashing functions, collision resolution (chaining vs open addressing), load factor considerations.
- Advanced structures: segment trees, Fenwick (BIT), disjoint set union (union-find), suffix arrays/trees, bloom filters.

Practical sections: choosing data structures for problems, space-time trade-offs, memory locality and cache-friendly designs.
