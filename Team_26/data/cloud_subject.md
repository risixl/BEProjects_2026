Cloud Computing provides on-demand computing infrastructure, platforms, and services.

Key topics:
- Cloud models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS explained, and usage scenarios.
- Virtualization and containers: VMs vs containers, Docker, Kubernetes, orchestration concepts.
- Storage and databases in cloud: object stores, block storage, managed databases, caching layers.
- Networking and security in cloud: VPCs, IAM, secure networking, load balancing, autoscaling.
- Reliability and availability: fault domains, replication, disaster recovery, RTO/RPO.
- Cost optimization: instance types, reserved vs spot instances, rightsizing.

Practical: deploying containerized apps, Terraform basics for infrastructure as code, CI/CD for cloud deployments.
