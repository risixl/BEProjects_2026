Computer Networks enable connectivity between devices and are built on layered protocols and hardware.

Important sections:
- Network models: OSI vs TCP/IP, role of each layer.
- Physical and data link layers: signaling, Ethernet, framing, MAC addressing, error detection/correction (CRC), switches and VLANs.
- Network layer: IPv4/IPv6 addressing, subnetting and CIDR, routing fundamentals, routing algorithms (distance-vector, link-state), routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- Transport layer: TCP vs UDP, reliability mechanisms (ACKs, retransmissions), flow control and congestion control (TCP Reno, Cubic), multiplexing using ports.
- Application protocols: HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, FTP, TLS/SSL basics; REST/HTTP semantics.
- Switching and routing devices, NAT, DHCP, VPNs, tunneling protocols.
- Wireless networks and mobile networking basics: Wi-Fi, cellular networks, handoff, signal considerations.
- Network security concepts: firewalls, TLS, IPS/IDS, DDoS mitigation, secure network design.

Examples and tools: packet capture with Wireshark/tcpdump, socket programming examples, traceroute and ping-based diagnostics.
