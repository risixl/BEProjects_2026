Computer Architecture studies how hardware and instruction sets are organized to implement efficient computation.

Sections:
- Digital logic and gates: combinational vs sequential circuits, adders, multiplexers.
- Instruction set architecture (ISA): RISC vs CISC, addressing modes, instruction encoding.
- Processor microarchitecture: datapath and control, pipelining, hazards (structural, data, control), pipeline interlocks.
- Memory hierarchy: caches (L1/L2/L3), associativity, cache replacement policies, cache coherence (MESI), virtual memory and TLBs.
- Parallelism: SIMD, MIMD, multicore processors, out-of-order execution, superscalar designs.
- I/O and buses: bus arbitration, DMA, device interfaces, interrupts.

Practical examples: pipeline diagrams, CPI calculation, benchmarking considerations.
