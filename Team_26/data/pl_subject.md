Programming Languages covers paradigms, language features, and implementation techniques.

Topics:
- Paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic, declarative.
- Language features: typing systems (static vs dynamic, strong vs weak), polymorphism, generics, closures, first-class functions.
- Scoping and lifetime: lexical vs dynamic scoping, garbage collection strategies, manual memory management.
- Runtime and compilation: interpreters vs compilers, JIT compilation, bytecode, ASTs and parsing.
- Concurrency models: threads, event-driven, actor model, async/await.

Examples and comparisons: comparing languages (Python, Java, C++, Rust), typical use-cases, and trade-offs in language design.
