Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses methods for building systems that exhibit aspects of intelligence: reasoning, planning, perception, and learning.

Key areas:
- Search and planning: uninformed and informed search (BFS, DFS, A*), heuristics, adversarial search (minimax, alpha-beta pruning).
- Knowledge representation and reasoning: propositional and predicate logic, ontologies, rule-based systems.
- Probabilistic models: Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models, Markov Decision Processes.
- Learning as part of AI: connections to machine learning, reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making.
- Natural language understanding basics: parsing, semantic representations, dialogue systems.
- Ethical and safety considerations: bias, explainability, alignment, privacy.

Examples and practical systems: classic AI agents, planning systems, and an overview of AI toolkits and libraries.
