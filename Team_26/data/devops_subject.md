DevOps unifies software development and operations to deliver software faster and more reliably.

Include sections on:
- CI/CD pipelines: continuous integration, automated testing, artifact promotion, continuous deployment.
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation; managing environments as code with versioning.
- Configuration management: Ansible, Puppet, Chef; immutable infrastructure patterns.
- Container orchestration: Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments), Helm charts, operators.
- Observability: logging, metrics (Prometheus), tracing (OpenTelemetry), dashboards and alerts.
- Release strategies: blue/green, canary, feature flags, rollback strategies.

Organizational practices: SRE principles, error budgets, blameless postmortems, and automation-first culture.
