Software Engineering covers principles and practices for building reliable, maintainable software.

Key topics:
- Software development life cycle: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance.
- Design principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI; architectural patterns (MVC, layered, microservices, event-driven).
- Design artifacts: UML, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, system decomposition.
- Testing strategies: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, TDD, mocking, test coverage metrics.
- DevOps and CI/CD: automated builds, pipelines, artifact management, deployment strategies (blue/green, canary), observability.
- Requirements engineering, estimation techniques, code review best practices, documentation and API design.

Case studies and examples: how to design for scalability, logging and monitoring strategies, and handling technical debt.
