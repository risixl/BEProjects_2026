Algorithm design and analysis concerns problem-solving techniques and complexity.

Include sections on:
- Complexity analysis: Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega, amortized analysis.
- Design paradigms: divide-and-conquer (quicksort, mergesort), dynamic programming (knapsack, LCS), greedy algorithms (activity selection, Huffman coding), backtracking, branch-and-bound.
- Graph algorithms: shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), all-pairs (Floyd-Warshall), MSTs (Prim, Kruskal), flows (Edmonds-Karp, Dinic).
- String algorithms: KMP, Rabin-Karp, suffix trees/arrays, trie-based pattern matching.
- Randomized and approximation algorithms: Monte Carlo methods, randomized quickselect, approximation schemes for NP-hard problems.
- NP-completeness basics: P vs NP, reductions, common NP-complete problems (SAT, 3-SAT, knapsack variants).

Practical guidance: algorithm selection for real problems, benchmarking and profiling, and heuristic strategies when optimal solutions are infeasible.
