# FINSHIELD AI: Fraud Detection in Finance

## 📌 Project Overview
Financial fraud is a growing challenge in the digital era, with millions of transactions happening every second. Traditional fraud detection methods often fail to capture complex relationships between entities such as accounts, transactions, and merchants.  

**FINSHIELD AI** leverages **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model these relationships as graphs, enabling more accurate detection of fraudulent activities. By representing transactions as nodes and their connections as edges, the system learns hidden patterns that distinguish legitimate behavior from fraud.
