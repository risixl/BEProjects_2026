# DeepFake Detection Using AI

## Project Overview
DeepFake Detection using AI is a system designed to identify AI-generated or manipulated images and videos. The project uses deep learning models to analyze facial features, texture inconsistencies, and visual artifacts commonly found in deepfakes.

## Objectives
- Detect whether an image or video is real or fake  
- Use deep learning for accurate classification  
- Provide confidence-based prediction results  
- Build a user-friendly web interface  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask  
- PyTorch  
- EfficientNet (CNN)  
- OpenCV  
- HTML, CSS  

## Methodology
1. Input image or video is uploaded through the web interface  
2. Media is preprocessed (resize, normalization, face analysis)  
3. Deep learning model extracts features  
4. Model predicts Real or Fake with probability score  

## Features
- Image-based deepfake detection  
- Video frame analysis  
- Probability-based prediction  
- Simple and interactive UI  

## Applications
- Fake media detection  
- Social media verification  
- Digital forensics  
- Cybersecurity
