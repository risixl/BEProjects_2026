Everwatch

Everwatch is an Android-based emergency safety application designed as a final-year college project. It provides a fast, reliable, and automated SOS mechanism that can be triggered even when the phone is locked, ensuring timely assistance during critical situations.

Project Overview

Everwatch focuses on minimizing user interaction during emergencies by offering multiple SOS activation methods and automating all critical response actions. Once triggered, the app immediately contacts emergency contacts, shares real-time location, and records audio/video evidence.

This project is developed as a **product-based Android application** and is **completed**.

How It Works

1. SOS is triggered via:
   - In-app SOS button  
   - Lock-screen widget  
   - Voice safeword  
2. Trigger is validated to avoid accidental activation  
3. Foreground emergency service starts  
4. Emergency call is placed to the primary contact  
5. SMS alerts with live GPS location are sent  
6. Audio and video recording begins automatically  
7. System continues monitoring until stopped

Testing

The application was tested under the following conditions:

- Screen locked  
- Silent mode  
- Do Not Disturb (DND) mode  
- Low battery  
- Background execution  
- Weak network connectivity  

All critical modules functioned reliably across tested scenarios.
